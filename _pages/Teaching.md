These are some lecture notes from courses I have taught. The notes are in Portuguese, as the courses were delivered in that language. While the material is not complete or fully polished, it may still be useful for students or anyone interested in the topics covered.

<em>Movie</em><br>

<em>My Rating:</em> 10/10 <br>
<em>My Thoughts:</em> This is easily my favorite anime of all time, movie or TV show. I believe it's the second anime I watched, and it was such a stunning experience watching it the first time. It's a beautiful emotionally-driven story and the characters have a lot of depth despite the short time that we get to see them. I enjoy rewatching this from time to time, and it hits me almost the same way as the first time each time I rewatch it.<br>

<em>TV Show (22 episodes)</em><br>
<em>Summary:</em> A piano prodigy who lost his ability to play after suffering a traumatic event in his childhood is forced back into the spotlight by an eccentric girl with a secret of her own.<br><br>
<em>My Rating:</em> 10/10 <br>
<em>My Thoughts:</em> This is definitely my favorite anime TV show of all time. I watched it at the start of high school, and I've never been able to watch it since then. It's really moving but also really gut-wrenching, and that makes it into an amazing show that hits you really hard once that you can never watch again due to how hard it hits you the first time. Like <em>A Silent Voice</em>, the characters have a lot of depth, and since we get to see them over the course of 22 episodes, they do get to be fleshed out a bit more. Other than the plot, the anime also has really nice visuals, and since it centers around music, it has a beautiful soundtrack that complements the emotion the plot delivers quite well. I strongly recommend this anime to anyone, but come prepared to tear up!<br>

<em>TV Show (Ongoing)</em><br>
<em>Summary:</em> Follows the adventures of Sung Jinwoo in a world that is constantly threatened by monsters and evil forces. In his battles Sung transforms himself from the weakest hunter of all mankind to one of the strongest hunters in existence.<br><br>
<em>My Rating:</em> 8.5/10 <br>
<em>My Thoughts:</em> If you want any plot, this anime doesn't have any. It's purely a power fantasy centered around eye-catching fights, but it's a really well done power fantasy. The visuals are amazing, the soundtrack is really good, the mechanics and worldbuilding are done well enough such that they don't detract from the anime. I think it's a testament to how good it is given that it manages to rank this high in my list without any plot at all. Sometimes, it's just nice to just completely turn off my brain and watch something with no plot at all.<br>
