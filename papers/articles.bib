     abstract = {Solar-like stars evolve through the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. This phase is characterized by increased radii, high luminosities, and significant mass loss. In order to understand the survival of companions during this phase, and explain the presence of planets orbiting white dwarfs, it is essential to examine the orbital evolution of these systems. Several physical mechanisms come into play for AGB stars, such as stellar mass-loss and tidal interactions between the star and its companion. On the one hand, evaluating mass-loss rates and accretion to the companion requires complex radiation-hydro-chemical simulations. On the other hand, the full history of tidal dissipation in low-mass stars during their late stages of evolution, which strongly depends on internal structure and boundary conditions, still requires dedicated studies. Finally a simultaneous treatment of winds and tides is required to predict a planet’s orbital evolution.},

<b>Aims.</b> We aim for a more accurate description of AGB wind morphologies by accounting for both the radiation force in dust-driven winds and the impact of a companion on the AGB wind morphology.

     abstract = {Low- and intermediate mass stars experience a significant mass loss during the last phases of their evolution, which obscures them in a vast, dusty envelope. Although it has long been thought this envelope is generally spherically symmetric in shape, recent high-resolution observations find that most of these stars exhibit complex and asymmetrical morphologies, most likely resulting from binary interaction. In order to improve our understanding about these systems, theoretical studies are needed in the form of numerical simulations. Currently, a handful of simulations exist, albeit they mainly focus on the hydrodynamics of the outflow. Hence, we here present the pathway to more detailed and accurate modelling of companion-perturbed outflows with, by discussing the missing but crucial physical and chemical processes. With these state-of-the-art simulations we aim to make a direct comparison with observations to unveil the true identity on the embedded systems.}

      abstract = {<b>Context:</b> The dusty winds of cool evolved stars are a major contributor of the newly synthesised material enriching the Galaxy and future generations of stars. However, the details of the physics and chemistry behind dust formation and wind launching have yet to be pinpointed. Recent spatially resolved observations show the importance of gaining a more comprehensive view of the circumstellar chemistry, but a comparative study of the intricate interplay between chemistry and physics is still difficult because observational details such as frequencies and angular resolutions are rarely comparable.
<b>Aims:</b> Aiming to overcome these deficiencies, ATOMIUM is an ALMA Large Programme to study the physics and chemistry of the circumstellar envelopes of a diverse set of oxygen-rich evolved stars under homogeneous observing conditions at three angular resolutions between ~0.02″−1.4″. Here we summarize the molecular inventory of these sources, and the correlations between stellar parameters and molecular content.
<b>Methods:</b> Seventeen oxygen-rich or S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red supergiant (RSG) stars have been observed in several tunings with ALMA Band 6, targeting a range of molecules to probe the circumstellar envelope and especially the chemistry of dust formation close to the star. We systematically assigned the molecular carriers of the spectral lines and measured their spectroscopic parameters and the angular extent of the emission of each line from integrated intensity maps.
<b>Results:<b> Across the ATOMIUM sample, we detect 291 transitions of 24 different molecules and their isotopologues. This includes several first detections in oxygen-rich AGB/RSG stars: PO v = 1, SO2 v1 = 1 and v2 = 2, and several high energy H2O transitions. We also find several first detections in S-type AGB stars: vibrationally excited HCN v2 = 2,3 and SiS v = 4,5,6, as well as first detections of the molecules SiC, AlCl, and AlF in W Aql. Overall, we find strong correlations between the following molecular pairs: CS and SiS, CS and AlF, NaCl and KCl, AlO and SO, SO2 and SO, and SO2 and H2O; meaning both molecules tend to have more detected emission lines in the same sources. The measured isotopic ratios of Si and S are found to be consistent with previous measurements, except for an anomalously high 29Si/30Si ratio of 4 ± 1 in the RSG VX Sgr.
<b>Conclusions:</b> This paper presents the overall molecular inventory and an initial analysis of the large ATOMIUM dataset, laying the groundwork for future work deriving molecular abundances and abundance profiles using radiative transfer modeling which will provide more rigorous tests for chemical models.}

Hydrodynamical simulations provide a way to study the impact of a companion on the shaping of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star out-flow.
<b>Aims.</b> Using smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of an AGB star undergoing mass loss, which also has a binary companion, we study the impact of including H I atomic line cooling on the flow morphology. We also study how this affects the properties of the accretion disks that form around the companion.
<b>Methods.</b> We used the PHANTOM code to perform high-resolution 3D SPH simulations of the interaction of a solar-mass companion with the outflow of an AGB star, using different wind velocities and eccentricities. We compared the model properties, computed with and without the inclusion of H I cooling. 
<b>Results.</b> The inclusion of H I cooling produces a sizeable decrease in the temperature, up to one order of magnitude, in the region closely surrounding the companion star. As a consequence, the morphological irregularities and relatively energetic (bipolar) outflows that were obtained without H I cooling no longer appear. In the case of an eccentric orbit and a low wind velocity, these morphologies are still highly asymmetric, but the same structures recur at every orbital period, making the morphology more regular. Flared accretion disks, with a (sub-)Keplerian velocity profile, are found to form around the companion in all our models with H I cooling, provided the accretion radius is small enough. The disks have radial sizes ranging from about 0.4 to 0.9 au and masses around 10‑7‑10‑8 M⊙. For the considered wind velocities, mass accretion onto the companion is up to a factor of 2 higher than predicted by the standard Bondi Hoyle Littleton rate, ranging between ~4 to 21% of the AGB wind mass loss rate. The lower the wind velocity at the location of the companion, the larger and the more massive the disk and the higher the mass accretion efficiency. In eccentric systems, the disk size, disk mass, and mass accretion efficiency vary, depending on the orbital phase.
<b>Conclusions.</b> H I cooling is an essential ingredient to properly model the medium around the companion where density-enhanced wind structures form and it favours the formation of an accretion disk.}

      abstract = {<b>Context.</b> Complex asymmetric 3D structures are observed in the outflows of evolved low- and intermediate-mass stars, and are believed to be shaped through the interaction of companions that remain hidden within the dense wind. One example is the AGB star R Aql, for which ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) observations have revealed complex wind structures that might originate from a higher-order stellar system.
<b>Aims.</b> We investigate how triple systems can shape the outflow of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and characterise the different wind structures that form. For simplicity, we solely focus on co-planar systems in a hierarchical, stable orbit, consisting of an AGB star with one relatively close companion, and another one at a large orbital separation.
<b>Methods.</b> We modelled a grid of hierarchical triple systems including a wind-launching AGB star, with the smoothed-particle- hydrodynamic PHANTOM code. We varied the outer companion mass, the AGB wind velocity, and the orbital eccentricities to study the impact of these parameters on the wind morphology. To study the impact of adding a triple companion, we additionally modelled and analysed a small grid of binary sub-systems, for comparison. To investigate if R Aql could be shaped by a triple system, we postprocessed one of our triple models with a radiative transfer routine, and compared this to data of the ALMA ATOMIUM programme.
<b>Results.</b> The characteristic wind structures resulting from a hierarchical triple system are the following. A large two-edged spiral wake results behind the outer companion star. This structure lies on top of the spiral structure formed by the close binary, which is itself affected by the orbital motion around the system's centre of mass, such that it resembles a snail-shell pattern. This dense inner spiral pattern interacts with, and strongly impacts, the spiral wake of the outer companion, resulting in a wave pattern on the outer edge of this spiral wake. The higher the mass of the outer companion, the larger the density enhancement and the more radially compressed the outer spiral. Lowering the wind velocity has a similar effect, and additionally results in an elongation of the global wind morphology. Introducing eccentricity in the inner and outer orbit of the hierarchical system results in complex phase-dependent wind-companion interactions, and consequently in asymmetries in the inner part of the wind and the global morphology, respectively. From the comparison of our models to the observations of R Aql, we conclude that this circumstellar environment might be shaped by a similar system to the ones modelled in this work, but an elaborate study of the observational data is needed to better determine the orbital parameters and characteristics of the central system.
<b>Conclusions.</b> The modelled outflow of an AGB star in a co-planar hierarchical systems is characterised by a large-scale spiral wake with a wavey outer edge, attached to the outer companion, on top of a compact inner spiral pattern that resembles a snail-shell pattern.}

     abstract = {Low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) account for a significant portion of the dust and chemical enrichment in their host galaxy. Here we present ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.24 mm around a sample of 17 stars from the ATOMIUM survey. From our analysis of the stellar contributions to the continuum flux, we find that the semi-regular variables all have smaller physical radii and fainter monochromatic luminosities than the Mira variables. Comparing these properties with pulsation periods, we find a positive trend between stellar radius and period only for the Mira variables with periods above 300 days and a positive trend between the period and the monochromatic luminosity only for the red supergiants and the most extreme AGB stars with periods above 500 days. We find that the continuum emission at 1.24 mm can be classified into four groups. "Featureless" continuum emission is confined to the (unresolved) regions close to the star for five stars in our sample, relatively uniform extended flux is seen for four stars, tentative bipolar features are seen for three stars, and the remaining five stars have unique or unusual morphological features in their continuum maps. These features can be explained by binary companions to 10 out of the 14 AGB stars in our sample. Based on our results we conclude that there are two modes of dust formation: well established pulsation-enhanced dust formation and our newly proposed companion-enhanced dust formation. If the companion is located close to the AGB star, in the wind acceleration region, then additional dust formed in the wake of the companion can increase the mass lost through the dust driven wind. This explains the different dust morphologies seen around our stars and partly accounts for a large scatter in literature mass-loss rates, especially among semiregular stars with small pulsation periods.}

     abstract = {<b>Context.</b> The emerging population of inert black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique opportunity to constrain black hole (BH) formation physics. These systems are composed of a stellar-mass BH in a wide orbit around a non-degenerate star with no observed Xray emission. Inert BHBs allow for narrow constraints to be inferred on the natal kick and mass loss during BH-forming core-collapse events.
<b>Aims.</b> In anticipation of the upcoming BLOeM survey, we aim to provide tight constraints on BH natal kicks by exploiting the full parameter space obtained from combined spectroscopic and astrometric data to characterize the orbits of inert BHBs. Multi-epoch spectroscopy from the BLOeM project will provide measurements of periods, eccentricities, and radial velocities for inert BHBs in the SMC, which complements Gaia astrometric observations of proper motions.
<b>Methods.</b> We present a Bayesian parameter estimation framework to infer natal kicks and mass loss during core-collapse from inert BHBs, accounting for all available observables, including the systemic velocity and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. The framework further allows for circumstances when some of the observables are unavailable, such as for the distant BLOeM sources which preclude resolved orbits.
<b>Results.</b> With our new framework, we are able to distinguish between BH formation channels, even in the absence of a resolved orbit. In cases when the pre-explosion orbit can be assumed to be circular, we precisely recover the parameters of the core-collapse, highlighting the importance of understanding the eccentricity landscape of pre-explosion binaries, both theoretically and observationally. Treating the near-circular, inert BHB, VFTS 243, as a representative of the anticipated BLOeM systems, we constrain the natal kick to less than 27 km/s and the mass loss to less than 2.9 Msun within a 90% credible interval.}

     abstract = {<b>Aims.</b> We aim to characterize the properties of the inner companion of the S-type AGB star pi1 Gru, and to identify plausible future evolution scenarios for this triple system.
<b>Methods.</b> We observed pi1 Gru with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE. In addition, we collected archival photometry data and used the Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. We derive the best orbital parameters from Bayesian inference.
<b>Results.</b> The inner companion, pi1 Gru C was located at 37.4 +/- 2.0 mas from the primary in June-July 2019 (projected separation of 6.05 +/- 0.55 au at 161.7 +/- 11.7 pc). The best orbital solution gives a companion mass of 0.86 (+0.22/-0.20) Msun (using the derived mass of the primary), and a semi-major axis of 7.05 (+0.54/-0.57) au. This leads to an orbital period of 11.0 (+1.7/-1.5) yr. The best solution is an elliptical orbit with eccentricity e = 0.35 (+0.18/-0.17), but a circular orbit cannot be totally excluded. The close companion can either be a K1V (F9.5V/K7V) star or a white dwarf. The ultraviolet and millimeter continuum photometry are consistent with the presence of an accretion disk around the close companion. The ultraviolet emission could then either originate in hot spots in an overall cooler disk, or also from a hot disk in case the companion is a white dwarf.
<b>Conclusions.</b> Though the close companion and the AGB star are interacting, and an accretion disk is observed around the companion, the mass-accretion rate is too low to cause a Ia supernova but could produce novae every ~900 yr. Short wavelength spatially resolved observations are needed to further constrain the nature of the C companion. Searches for close-in companions similar to this system will help to better understand the physics of mass- and angular-momentum transfer, and orbital evolution in the late evolutionary stages.}
